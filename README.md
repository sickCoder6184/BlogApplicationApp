# BlogApplicationApp Using Spring-Boot(Backend)

**Overview**

This repository contains the backend implementation for a Blog Application developed using Spring Boot. The application supports CRUD operations, pagination, and search functionalities for managing blog posts. The project uses MySQL Workbench for database management and Postman for testing the APIs.

**Features**

  - **User to Post**: One to Many
  - **User to Comment**: One to Many
  - **Comment to Post**: Many to One
  - **Post to User**: Many to One

**Technologies Used**

- **Spring Boot**: Framework for building the backend application.
- **Spring Data JPA**: For ORM (Object Relational Mapping).
- **MySQL**: Database management.
- **Postman**: For API testing.

**Getting Started**

**Prerequisites**

- Java 8 or higher
- Maven
- MySQL Workbench
- Postman

**Development Steps**

**1\. Create Entities**

- Define the entities User, Post, Comment, and Categories with appropriate attributes and relationships
  
- Create DTO classes for each entity to facilitate data transfer between client and server, containing only the necessary attributes for the API.

**3\. Create Repositories**

- Define repository interfaces for each entity by extending JpaRepository to provide CRUD operations and database interactions.

**4\. Create Services**

- Define service interfaces for each entity, specifying the methods for business logic and operations to be implemented.

**5\. Implement Services**

- Create service implementation classes for each service interface, implementing the business logic and operations defined in the service interfaces.

**6\. Create Controllers**

- Define controller classes for each entity, mapping the endpoints for CRUD operations, pagination, and search functionality, using the service classes to handle requests.

**7\. Define Endpoints**

- Specify API endpoints in the controller classes for creating, reading, updating, and deleting entities, as well as additional endpoints for pagination and search.
